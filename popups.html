  <p>Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no <code>margin</code> by default, so use <a href="/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/">spacing utilities</a> as needed.</p>
  <p>Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various <a href="#sizing">sizing options</a>.</p>
  <p>Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Below are examples of what’s supported.</p>
